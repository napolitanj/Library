Library

This application is for The Odin Project's "Library" Project. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate and develop understanding of objects and object constructors.

--------------------
How to use this app:

Click the "Add book" button to add a new book.

When the add book window is open you will be unable to interact with other parts of the interface. You must include a title, author and number of pages to proceed.

Once you've submitted a book, you will see it render in the interface. You can change the status of whether the book has been read or not by clicking the "Read/Not Read" button.

Click "Remove Book" to remove a book.

Your browser will store your data until you clear local storage.
